## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Technologies Used

• Javascript, AJAX, and jQuery

• Grunt serve and grunt deploy to manage development and production servers

• Git, Github, and Github Pages for version control

## What I have learned so far

## Unsolved Problems

• I'm aware that this code is DRY – but it was more important to me to grasp the concepts and build a functioning game.

• The board is playable but there are features not yet implemented:
    • the players can still change a square after its been filled
    • the buttons for creating a new game and reset the game don't work
    • The score boxes don't function

• Hide/Show not implemented yet:
  • need to show the sign-in and sign-up fields and hide the change password field and sign out button on loggin screen
  • Once logged in, need to hide the sign-in and sign-up fields, and show the sign-out button

• Code better to not have DRY code. simplifing the events.js by a single event handler rather than repeating code in a long if/else statement

## Wireframes

I had a three revisions of my wireframes. At the beginning I wasn't quite grasping the single-page concept as far as my sketches on paper were going.
