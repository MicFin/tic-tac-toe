## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Technologies Used

• Javascript, AJAX, and jQuery

• Grunt serve and grunt deploy to manage development and production servers

• Git, Github, and Github Pages for version control

## What I have learned so far

Even though I know I will not make requirements at least by the first due date, I have learned a lot. When it comes to learning new technical skills I grasp the concepts a bit slow. I have to remind myself to slow down and read through the problem and eventually I will comprehend. 

## Unsolved Problems

• I'm aware that this code is DRY – but it was more important to me to grasp the concepts and build a functioning game.

• The board is playable but there are features not yet implemented:
    • the players can still change a square after its been filled
    • the buttons for creating a new game and reset the game don't work
    • The score boxes don't function

• Hide/Show not implemented yet:
  • need to show the sign-in and sign-up fields and hide the change password field and sign out button on loggin screen
  • Once logged in, need to hide the sign-in and sign-up fields, and show the sign-out button

• Code better to not have DRY code. simplifing the events.js by a single event handler rather than repeating code in a long if/else statement

## Wireframes

I had a three revisions of my wireframes. At the beginning I wasn't quite grasping the single-page concept as far as my sketches on paper were going.

## User Stories

• As a user, I want to sign in so that I can play the game.

• As a user, I want to sign up so that I can play the game.

• As a user, I want to click a box so that I can put an X or an O on the board.

• As a user, I want to click the button so that I can log out.

BONUS:
• As a user, I want to search for an opponent so that I can play against them.
